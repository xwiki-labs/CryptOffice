        <h1>Document Review</h1>
        <p>When somebody shares a file with you that has review permissions, you need to use the document <b>Review</b> feature.</p>
        <p>If you are the reviewer, then you can use the <b>Review</b> option to review the document, change the sentences, phrases and other page elements, correct spelling, and do other things to the document without actually editing it. All your changes will be recorded and shown to the person who sent the document to you.</p>
        <p>If you are the person who sends the file for the review, you will need to display all the changes which were made to it, view and either accept or reject them.</p>
        <p>In either case the <b>Review</b> is enabled with the help of the <img alt="Review button" src="../images/review.png" /> button in the right lower corner at the status bar. You can click the <b>Review</b> button to enable both <b>Track Changes</b> and <b>Changes Panel</b> options, or use the arrow next to it to select which options you want to be enabled.</p>
        <p>Once selected the <b>Changes Panel</b> is displayed:</p>
        <p><img alt="Review panel" src="../images/review_panel.png" /></p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: it is not necessary for the reviewer to display the <b>Changes Panel</b>, the <b>Track Changes</b> option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled when the document is shared with review only access rights.</p>
        <p>To accept the changes use the appropriate <b>Changes Panel</b> menu option (<b>Accept</b>) or the <b>Accept</b> <img alt="Accept button" src="../images/review_accept.png" /> button of the change notification.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: if you review the document please do not use <b>Accept</b> as your changes will not be visible to anyone else.</p>
        <p>Use the <img alt="To Previous Change button" src="../images/review_previous.png" /> <b>To Previous Change</b> and the <img alt="To Next Change button" src="../images/review_next.png" /> <b>To Next Change</b> buttons to navigate among the changes or use the the <b>Accept Current Change</b> menu option of the <b>Changes Panel</b> to progress from one change to another. To quickly accept all the changes, the <b>Accept All Changes</b> menu option of the <b>Changes Panel</b> can be used.</p>
        <p>To reject the current change click the <img alt="Reject button" src="../images/review_reject.png" /> <b>Reject</b> button or use the <b>Reject Current Change</b> menu option of the <b>Changes Panel</b> and move on to the next available change. To quickly reject all the changes, the <b>Reject All Changes</b> menu option of the <b>Changes Panel</b> can be used.</p>
